* Anatomy of the tarball

The Clon distribution has the following shape:

./src/		;; source directory
./sbcl/	        ;; SBCL grovel module
./share/	;; data files
./doc/		;; documentation
./demo/         ;; demo program


* Building

** Edit Makefile.cnf if needed
All make targets from the toplevel propagate to the subdirectories.

** Type "make" from the toplevel directory
The build phase generates the demo program and the documentation. By default,
documentation is built in info, PDF and HTML formats. If you want other
formats (DVI and PostScript are available), type "make all-formats" in the doc
directory. You can also type individually "make dvi" and/or "make ps" in order
to get the corresponding format.


* Installing

** Type "make install" from the toplevel directory
This installs the ASDF system file, the data and the documentation. The demo
program is not installed anywhere.


* Uninstalling

Type "make uninstall".
