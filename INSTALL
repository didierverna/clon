2 Installation
**************

First of all, see Clon’s homepage for tarballs, Git repository and
online documentation.  Clon is an ASDF 3 library.  If you download a
Clon tarball, or clone the repository, you need to unpack somewhere in
the ASDF source registry.  Otherwise, Clon is also available via
Quicklisp.  *Note Supported Platforms::, for more information on
portability and dependencies.

   Clon’s main system is called ‘net.didierverna.clon’.  Depending on
your installation, you may thus either ‘asdf:load-system’, or
‘ql:quickload’ it in your Lisp image.  If you encounter grovel or ffi
related problems, you may need to set the ‘CC’ environment variable to a
working compiler before loading.

   Alternatively, if you just want to use the core library without all
the platform-dependent bells and whistles (*note Non-ANSI Features::),
you may also just load the ‘net.didierverna.clon.core’ system.

   In addition to the library itself, the Clon distribution offers
documentation in the form of 3 different manuals, some data files like
sample themes (*note (clon-enduser)Theme Creation::), and a couple of
demonstration programs.  If you want to benefit from all these wonders,
some bits of manual installation are needed.  After unpacking, please
perform the following steps, in order.

  1. Edit ‘make/config.make’ to your specific needs.

  2. Type ‘make’ to compile the documentation (end-user manual, user
     manual and possibly reference manual).  By default, the
     documentation is built in info, PDF and HTML formats.  If you want
     other formats (DVI and PostScript are available), type ‘make
     all-formats’.  You can also type individually ‘make dvi’ and/or
     ‘make ps’ in order to get the corresponding format.

  3. As documented in ‘make/config.make’, the reference manual is only
     generated if you have SBCL and the Declt library at hand (see
     <http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~didier/software/lisp/misc.php#declt>).

  4. Type ‘make install’ to install both the documentation and the data
     files.  If you have compiled the documentation in DVI and
     PostScript format, those will be installed as well.  The same goes
     for the reference manual.

   Type ‘make uninstall’ to uninstall the library.

   Finally, if you want to play with the demo programs, ‘cd’ to the
‘demo/’ directory, and type either ‘make asdf-dump’ or ‘make clon-dump’.
These are two different methods for producing standalone executables,
via ASDF or via Clon itself.  *Note Dumping Executables:: for more
information.  ‘make install’ does not do anything with the demo
programs.


8.1 Configuration
=================

Some aspects of Clon’s behavior can be configured _before_ the library
is actually loaded.  Clon stores its user-level configuration (along
with some other setup parameters) in another ASDF system called
‘net.didierverna.clon.setup’ (and the eponym package).  In order to
configure the library (I repeat, prior to loading it), you will
typically do something like this:
(require "asdf")
(asdf:load-system :net.didierverna.clon.setup)
(net.didierverna.clon.setup:configure <option> <value>)

 -- Function: configure KEY VALUE
     Set KEY to VALUE in the current Clon configuration.

   Out of curiosity, you can also inquire the current configuration for
specific options with the following function.
 -- Function: configuration KEY
     Return KEY’s value in the current Clon configuration.

   Currently, the following options are provided.
:swank-eval-in-emacs
     This option is only useful if you use Slime, and mostly if you plan
     on hacking Clon itself.  The library provides indentation
     information for some of its functions directly embedded in the
     code.  This information can be automatically transmitted to Emacs
     when the ASDF system is loaded if you set this option to ‘t’.
     However, note that for this to work, the Slime variable
     ‘slime-enable-evaluate-in-emacs’ must also be set to ‘t’ in your
     Emacs session.  If you’re interested to know how this process
     works, I have described it in this blog entry
     (http://www.didierverna.net/blog/index.php?post/2011/07/20/One-more-indentation-hack).
:restricted
     Some non-ANSI features of Clon require external functionality that
     may not be available in all contexts.  Normally, Clon should
     autodetect this and switch to so-called _restricted mode_ at
     build-time (*note Non-ANSI Features::).  If Clon has failed to
     autodetect the problem (in which case I would like to know), or if
     for some reason, you explicitly want to disable those features, you
     may set the ‘:restricted’ configuration option to ‘t’.  Another way
     to do it, without even bothering with configuration is to just use
     the ‘net.didierverna.clon.core’ system instead of the regular one.
:dump
     This option is only used by the ABCL port.  *note Dumping
     Executables::, provides more information on its use.


8.2 Non-ANSI Features
=====================

One feature of Clon that is beyond the ANSI standard is terminal
autodetection (it requires an ‘ioctl’ call and hence a foreign function
interface).  Terminal autodetection is used in several situations, for
turning on highlighting automatically and for detecting a terminal line
width.

   If, for some reason, terminal autodetection is not available, Clon
will work in so-called _restricted mode_.  This means that
‘--clon-highlight=auto’ won’t work (highlighting will _not_ be turned on
automatically on a tty).  For the same reason, unless otherwise
specified via either the ‘COLUMNS’ environment variable or the
‘--clon-line-width’ option, terminal output will be formatted for 80
columns regardless of the actual terminal width (*note
(clon-enduser)Global Control::).


Appendix A Supported Platforms
******************************

Clon is an ASDF 3 library.  It currently works on Unix (including MacOS
X) and Windows (Cygwin or MinGW) and has been ported to 8 Common Lisp
implementations.  It requires ‘editor-hints.named-readtables’.  The
following table lists the supported platforms and some additional,
platform-dependent dependencies.

Compiler   Minimum Version   Dependencies
-------------------------------------------------
SBCL       1.0.56
CMU-CL     20b
CCL
ECL        11.1.2(1)
CLISP                        ‘cffi’ (optional)
ABCL       1.1.0(2)
Allegro(3)                   ‘cffi’ (optional)
LispWorks                    ‘cffi’ (optional)

A.1 CLISP, Allegro and LispWorks specificities
==============================================

As mentioned in the above table, CLISP, Allegro and LispWorks dependency
on ‘cffi’ is optional.  They need ‘cffi’ in order to implement terminal
autodetection only (note that many other implementations come with their
own foreign function interface).  If ‘cffi’ cannot be found when the
ASDF system is loaded (or in the case of CLISP, if it has been compiled
without ‘ffi’ support), you get a big red blinking light and a warning
but that’s all.  Clon will still work, although in restricted mode.

A.2 ABCL specificities
======================

Clon’s ABCL port currently has two limitations:
   • It only works in restricted mode (*note Non-ANSI Features::).
   • Since Java doesn’t have a ‘putenv’ or ‘setenv’ function (!!), the
     ‘modify-environment’ restart, normally proposed when an environment
     variable is set to a bogus value, is unavailable (*note
     (clon-enduser)Error Management::).
